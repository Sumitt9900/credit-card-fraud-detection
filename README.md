# credit-card-fraud-detection
This Python script builds a model to detect credit card fraud. It preprocesses data from a Kaggle dataset, balances the classes using random undersampling, and then trains a Random Forest classifier. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, and the most predictive features are visualized.
